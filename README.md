# Newbie Rust RFCs (**INCOMPLETE**)
A handpicked collection of essential Rust RFCs, tailored for newcomers embarking on an in-depth exploration of Rust.

## Motivation
Rust's development is grounded in thoughtful discussions and meticulous planning, as evident in its comprehensive RFCs (Request for Comments). These documents are a goldmine of information, providing deep insights into the language's features and philosophy.

However, the vast number of RFCs can be overwhelming, especially for beginners striving to understand the intricacies of Rust. This project is an initiative to demystify this journey. It offers a well-organized, learner-friendly pathway through the most influential and foundational RFCs, helping beginners navigate Rust's complexities with ease.
